# NYC City Bike Analysis

## Analysis Overview
As we prepare to begin our Des Moines bike-sharing program, we wanted to analyze an existing bike-sharing program in New York City. The Big Apple may not be the same as Des Moines, but the data from New York City will be able to give us key information about how the program works, some statistical breakdowns and an understanding of how long bikes are used for.

## Results

We looked at a total of 7 different [visualizations](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/vytas.stuopis/viz/NYCCitibike_16751337223540/CityBikeFindings)
1. August Peak Hours - Tells us what hours of the day are the busiest in August

## Summary
Overall there are a few major takeaways we can see as we look towards expanding this program into Des Moines:
* Most riders are riding for now more than 45 minutes 
* Most subscribers of the service are males
* Wednesdays are the slowest day of the work week for the program

Two more interesting vizualizations we'd like to have for future analysis would be:
1. What effect the weather has on the bike-sharing program
2. The age breakdown of the subscriber base v. customer base
