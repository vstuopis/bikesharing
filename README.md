# NYC City Bike Analysis

## Analysis Overview
As we prepare to begin our Des Moines bike-sharing program, we wanted to analyze an existing bike-sharing program in New York City. The Big Apple may not be the same as Des Moines, but the data from New York City will be able to give us key information about how the program works, some statistical breakdowns and an understanding of how long bikes are used for.
